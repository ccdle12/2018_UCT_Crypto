#### Pinocchio Protocol 

- https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279 

Suppose Alice wants to prove to Bob she knows $c_1, c_2, c_3 \in \mathbb{F}$ s.t. $c_1 \cdot c_2 \cdot (c_1 + c_3) = 7$.

Let $\mathsf{Com}$ be a (Pedersen) commitment. 

1. Alice computes polynomials $V(x), W(x), Y(x)$ and $H(x)$
2. Bob chooses a random point $s \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and computes $\mathsf{Com}(T(s))$
3. Alice computes $\mathsf{Com}(V(s)), \mathsf{Com}(W(s)), \mathsf{Com}(Y(s))$ and $\mathsf{Com}(H(s))$ and sends it to Bob 
4. Bob checks $\mathsf{Com}(V(s) \cdot W(s) - Y(s)) =  \mathsf{Com}(T(s) \cdot H(s))$
   - If Alice does not have a satisfying assignment, she cannot find $V(x), W(x), Y(x)$ and $H(x)$ s.t. $V(x) \cdot W(x) - Y(x) = H(x) \cdot T(x)$
   - Step 4 does not hold.



**Question.** 

- In Step 3, how to compute $\sf{Com}(T(s))$ without knowing $T(x)$?
  - Only Alice knows the target polynomial $T(x)$
- In Step 4,  how to compute $\mathsf{Com}(V(s)), \mathsf{Com}(W(s)), \mathsf{Com}(Y(s))$ and $\mathsf{Com}(H(s))$? 
  - Only Bob knows the random point $s$



#### Blind Evaulation of a Polynomial

Suppose Alice has a polynomial $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots a_d x^d$ and Bob has a point $s \in \mathbb{F}_p$.

Alice and Bob wish to compute $\sf{Com}(P(s))$.

- naive method;
  - Alice sends $P(x)$ to Bob and he computes $\mathsf{Com}(P(s))$ (and sends it to Alice).
    - Bob *can learn* $p(x)$.
  - Bob sends $s$ to Alice and she computes $\mathsf{Com}(P(s))$ (and sends it to Bob). 
    - Alice *can learn* $s$.



**Remark.** Since Pedersen commitment supports addition, 
$$
\sf{Com}(x)^a \cdot \sf{Com}(y)^b = \sf{Com}(ax + by)
$$
and thus, Pedersen commitment also supports *linear combinations*



- using Pedersen commitment;
  1. Bob sends to Alice $\mathsf{Com}(1)$, $\mathsf{Com}(s)$, $\ldots$, $\mathsf{Com}(s^d)$
  2. Alice computes

$$
\mathsf{Com}(P(s)) = \mathsf{Com}(1)^{a_0} \mathsf{Com}(s)^{a_1} \cdots \mathsf{Com}(s^d)^{a^d}
$$

​	$\Rightarrow$ Alice *cannot* learn $s$ and Bob *cannot* learn $P(x)$, neither.



##### The Remaining Problem 

1. making sure Alice computes her polynomials according to an assignment
   - resolved by introducing "verifiable" blind polynomial evaluation
2. hiding the assignment
   - resolved by masking the polynomials
3. computing multiplications from two commitments
   - resolved by the use of pairing of elliptic curves
4. non-interactive

 

##### Boolean Circuits and QSPs

- Quadratic Span Programs (QSPs) are very similar to QAPs.
- QSPs use only two sets of polynomials $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ since they only supports Boolean wire values.
- The divisibility check is updated to

$$
P(x) = V(x) \cdot W(x)
$$
